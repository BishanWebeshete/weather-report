# weather-report

A web application for users who want to view the weather forecast for the city of their choice

This project was created using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS to obtain a strong foundation on these
technologies. I also wanted to develop a stronger understanding of API's and how to properly query and display
their information depending on the users desires. This project was intended to inform the users of what their
day would look like at any location.
